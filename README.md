# PCI DSS Inactive User Audit (Requirement 8.2.6)

This audit simulates a PCI DSS 4.0.1 Requirement 8.2.6 control test to detect inactive user accounts in Active Directory (AD) that have not been used for over 90 days. The goal is to identify and remediate stale accounts that may pose a security risk.

## ðŸ“‹ Mock Interview Summary

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| **Whatâ€™s the PCI DSS requirement being tested?** | Requirement 8.2.6 â€” Remove/disable inactive user accounts within 90 days. |
| **What was your audit scope?** | Windows Active Directory environment. Focused on a user account inactive for 400+ days. |
| **What tool did you use to validate inactivity?** | Used PowerShell to simulate lastLogonTimestamp and reviewed AD attributes. |
| **What AD attribute did you check?** | `lastLogonTimestamp` (converted to FileTime format). |
| **What findings did you document?** | User account was still active, had not logged in for 400+ days. Password and group membership were still valid. |
| **What action did you take?** | Account was labeled as inactive, validated, and disabled. |
| **Whatâ€™s the remediation if this is a real finding?** | Implement AD scripts or use IAM tools to automatically disable stale accounts every 90 days. |

## ðŸ§  Lessons Learned
> PCI auditors often request a review of `lastLogonTimestamp`. Your ability to simulate, detect, document, and remediate inactive accounts shows you're ready for GRC or IAM analyst responsibilities.
