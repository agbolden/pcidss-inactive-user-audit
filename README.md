## üß† Mock Interview ‚Äì Inactive User Accounts

| Question | Response |
|----------|----------|
| How do you identify inactive users in Active Directory? | We audit the `lastLogonTimestamp` and check for accounts with no login activity in the past 90+ days. |
| What tools do you use for this process? | Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC), PowerShell, and audit documentation. |
| What‚Äôs the purpose of this control? | To reduce security risk by disabling unused accounts which could be exploited. |
| What‚Äôs your process once an inactive user is found? | Document, verify, notify stakeholders, disable the account, and implement remediation. |

## ‚úÖ Remediation Plan

1. **Disable Inactive Account:**
   - Account was manually disabled after 400+ days of inactivity.

2. **Documentation:**
   - Description field updated with inactivity status and simulated date.
   - Findings logged and retained for audit trail.

3. **Group Audit Follow-Up:**
   - Membership reviewed; further cleanup planned to remove access.

4. **Password Reset Enforcement:**
   - A policy will be enforced to reset stale credentials if reactivated.

5. **Prevention Control:**
   - Set up automated PowerShell scripts to detect future inactive accounts.
